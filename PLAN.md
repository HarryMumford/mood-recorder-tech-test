# Plan

1. Setup/research

_Todo_

- [x] Connect db and view data
- [ ] Use concurrently to run both front and back end together
- [x] Research graphical display options
- [x] Research about common Typescript differences and how this affects testing

2. Design

_MVP_ 

My minimal viable product for this task will be a simple pie chart displaying the mood of one care recipient. For this I will need:

1. A route in the backend querying the db for all the moods of one recipient
2. Some charting library for react to dynamically render the pie chart
